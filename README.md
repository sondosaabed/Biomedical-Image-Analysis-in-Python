# Biomedical-Image-Analysis-in-Python
The field of biomedical imaging has exploded in recent years - but for the uninitiated, even loading data can be a challenge! In this introductory course, I have learned the fundamentals of image analysis using NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. I have navigated through a whole-body CT scan, segment a cardiac MRI time series, and determined whether Alzheimerâ€™s disease changes brain structure. I have finished the course with a solid toolkit for entering this dynamic field.
